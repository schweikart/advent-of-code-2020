# Day 08: Handheld Halting
The ["Handheld halting" problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8) is about emulating assembler-like instructions.

## Running this solution
Required software:
* [node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/) (tested with node v6.9.0)

Run the solution:
1. Replace the `input.txt` file with your puzzle input.
2. Run `npm start` in this directory.
3. The solutions to both the first and second part will be printed to the console.

## File structure
* [`./index.js`](./index.js): My solution to both part one and two of this puzzle.
* [`./input.txt`](./input.txt): My personal puzzle input for this challenge.
* [`./package.json`](./package.json): Configuration file for NPM
* [`./README.md`](./README.md): documentation for this solution :)
